# OpenCart(Frontend)-Manual Testing
This repository showcases the manual testing process for a small web application. It includes the Test Plan, Test Case scenarios, and a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) to track the requirements and their corresponding tests.

## Test Plan
Contains the Test Plan Document, which details the scope, strategy, and deliverables for the OpenCart testing project. It outlines the testing approach, the resources required, and the timeline for completion.

## Test Scenarios
Includes high-level Test Scenario Documents outlining areas of testing for OpenCart, such as Login Functionality, Cart Features, and Product Management. These scenarios provide a broad overview of the key features to be tested without going into the specifics of each test case.

## Test Cases
Contains detailed Test Case Documents that define the exact steps, input data, expected results, and the pass/fail criteria for executing the tests outlined in the Test Scenarios. Each test case helps ensure that the functionality works as intended.

## Test Execution
Holds the Test Execution Results Document, which shows the outcome of each executed test case, including whether tests passed or failed. It also includes any issues, observations, or anomalies found during testing.

## RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)
Includes the RTM Document, which maps each functional requirement to its corresponding test cases. This ensures that all requirements are covered by tests, providing visibility into the completeness of the testing process.

## Bug Reports
Contains detailed Bug Reports, which document any issues identified during the testing process. Each report includes a description of the bug, severity, steps to reproduce, and current status (open, resolved, or fixed). These reports help track and resolve defects during the testing lifecycle.
